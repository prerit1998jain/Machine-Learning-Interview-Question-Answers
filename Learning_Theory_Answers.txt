QUESTION 1: DESCRIBE BIAS AND VARIANCE WITH EXAMPLES.
ANSWER: BIAS: Bias is similar to the mean squared error, or any measure of error
              which you may know. A model with high bias is not acceptable. Model
              quality is inversely proportional to Bias.

        VARIANCE: Variance shows how subject the model is to outliers. Meaning
                  those values which are far away from the mean of the variable.
                  A model with very high variance, is a more complex model, which
                  is fit to the training data.

        To describe a set of values of a particular variable, let us say we define
        a polynomial function, so as we increase the degree of polynomial to fit
        the training data, the variance of the model increases while the bias
        decreases. While in lower degrees, bias is large but variance (complexiety)
        is very low.

        So, while selecting a model we should select the best possible Bias-VARIANCE
        trade-off, for ensuring a better quality model.

        SUMMARY: HIGH BIAS: --------> UNDERFITTING.
                 HIGH VARIANCE: ----> OVERFITTING.
