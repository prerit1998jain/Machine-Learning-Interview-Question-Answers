########  QUESTIONS ON LEARNING THEORY ######

QUESTION 1: DESCRIBE BIAS AND VARIANCE WITH EXAMPLES. (**)
ANSWER: BIAS: Bias of the model is expected generalization error even if we were
              to fit in a very large-training set because there will be some patterns
              in the data that model can't capture due to lack of complexiety.

        VARIANCE: We would say that a model has a high variance, if it produces,
                  very low training eroor but a high generalization error because
                  of underfitting.

        To describe a set of values of a particular variable, let us say we define
        a polynomial function, so as we increase the degree of polynomial to fit
        the training data, the variance of the model increases while the bias
        decreases. While in lower degrees, bias is large but variance (complexiety)
        is very low.

        So, while selecting a model we should select the best possible Bias-VARIANCE
        trade-off, for ensuring a better quality model.

        SUMMARY: HIGH BIAS: --------> UNDERFITTING.
                 HIGH VARIANCE: ----> OVERFITTING.

QUESTION 2: WHAT IS EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION?
ANSWER: In a general setting, We want to minimize the true risk associated with
        our model, that it's predictions will deviate from the ground truth.
        But, since we don't know the true family of functions, or the true joint probability
        distribution which the data follows, it is not possible to calculate
        true expected risk in practical applications, so instead we calculate an
        empirical risk on the training dataset on our assumed hypothesis functions,
        and try to learn it's parameters by minimizing the empirical risk. This learning
        procedure is known as Empirical Risk Minimization.
